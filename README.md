# Armenian_Dialects
Armenian Dialect translation website using Google Translate API

# Background:
The Armenian language is one which is over 5,000 years old, during which it has gone through many changes, both structurally and culturally. Our alphabet, created in 401 AD by St. Mesrob Mashdots, helped preserve the Armenian nations throughout the millenia until today. Prior to the Armenian Genocide, there were an estimated 50-60 dialects of Armenian spoken. In modern times, many of those dialects are extinct or endangered as a result of the expulsion of many Armenians outside of their historic lands, forced assimilation, or simply a lack of speakers and resources. There are 2 standard dialects of modern Armenian: Eastern and Western. Eastern Armenian is the main dialect found in Armenia, Artsakh, and many other post-soviet countries. Western Armenian is primarily found throughout the diaspora, with large speaking populations in the North America, Europe, Middle East, and Australia. Although both are mutually intelligible to high level speakers, low level speakers and beginner Armenian learners typically have great trouble finding resources to be able to connect the two main dialects.

# Project Statement:
The goal of this project is to create a website, in which users can input something in any language, and translate it to any dialect of Armenian. Prinicpally we will start by first being able to take output from Google Translate, which is given in standard Eastern Armenian, and translate it to Western Armenian. The difference primarily comes in the form of verb form/conjugation, vocabulary, and sentence structure. 

Future Enhancements may include:
- Support for more dialects of Armenian
- Adding transliteration of Armenian output back into English
- Suggesting commonly used slang words under the proper Armenian translations
- History of each dialect
